These are the scripts we used to run the GSEM GWAS of the Addiction Risk Factor. Here is the GWAS citation:
Hatoum, A.S., Colbert, S.M.C., Johnson, E.C. et al. Multivariate genome-wide association meta-analysis of over 
1 million subjects identifies loci underlying multiple substance use disorders. 
Nat. Mental Health 1, 210â€“223 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-023-00034-y

The scripts run over a large parallel computing architecture. These were the steps we followed and exact 
scripts we used to run those analyses.
